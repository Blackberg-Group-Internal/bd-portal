    Service Requirements: Highlight specific requirements in the RFP document and assess whether your company’s services fully meet, partially meet, or do not meet each requirement. Where applicable, provide a confidence level (e.g., High, Medium, Low) that matches the service requirements based on your company's experience.

    Company Expertise:

    Identify specific experiences, previous projects, or accomplishments that demonstrate alignment with the RFP's requirements.
    Include examples from similar projects that illustrate your capability to address the scope of work or unique project elements.
    Gaps and Mitigation Strategies: Identify any potential gaps in the company’s ability to meet specific requirements of the RFP. Provide mitigation strategies to address these gaps, such as sub-contracting, partnerships, hiring experts, or training.

    - Specific Requirements: Note any explicit requirements listed in the RFP for the position, such as certifications, skills, or experience levels. If not explicitly mentioned, put "N/A."
    - Estimated Hours: Estimate a low number of hours required for each role based on the overall scope of work and deliverables. Be conservative in your estimate, considering:
    - Breaking down the project into phases or milestones.
    - Dividing the work into smaller, incremental tasks to spread the load across the timeline.
    - Utilizing roles in parallel to ensure efficiency without overestimation.
    
    Keep the estimated hours within realistic and conservative ranges based on typical industry projects, aiming for efficiency and avoiding inflated values.

    Contract Length: Extract information on the duration or estimated length of the contract, including start and end dates if available.

    Estimated Timeline: Outline a probable timeline for the project, including key phases and milestones, as implied by the RFP. This should be realistic but present an efficient turnaround for an optimized delivery timeline.

    Cost Estimate: Estimate the potential budget for this project based on the scope of work, timeline, and personnel requirements. Where personnel roles are listed, assume an hourly rate of $200 and factor in estimated work hours.

    Ensure that each section is clearly labeled, concise, and well-structured to facilitate easy reference."
